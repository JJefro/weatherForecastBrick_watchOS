# Weather Forecast Brick

**Stack -** SwiftUI, Combine, CoreLocation, Async/Await <br />

Application that works with the location and weather API. <br />
<br />
The user can find weather information in any city. The more foggy and the worse the visibility, the worse the brick will be visible.<br />

When user taps on the current location button, the weather in the area is immediately displayed.<br />

The stronger the wind, the more the brick will sway.<br />

If there is a thunderstorm or rain, the brick gets wet.<br />

If it snows, the brick becomes snowy.<br />

And if it's too hot and dry outside, the brick gets cracked.<br />
